## What is ShareNet?

ShareNet is your go-to platform for everything sharing on campus. Whether you need a textbook for a semester, want to sell your old laptop, or lost your favorite hoodie — ShareNet has got you covered.

**Think of it as a trusted marketplace + lost & found + community board — all in one place, exclusively for your campus.**

## What Can You Do on ShareNet?

### 🛒 **Need Something? Get It From a Fellow Student**

Instead of buying brand new, find what you need from students who already have it:

- **Rent** a projector for your presentation

Turn your unused items into value:

- **Rent out** your bike when you're not using it
- **Sell** your old electronics
- **Give away** things you no longer need and help someone out

### 🔍 **Lost Something? We'll Help You Find It**

Accidents happen. When they do:

- Post about your lost item
- Get notified when someone finds it

## 🏆 Trust Score — Your Reputation

### What is Trust Score?

Your Trust Score (0-100) shows the community how reliable you are. It's displayed on your profile and next to your name on listings.

### How to Build Trust

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ Return items on time | +5 points |
| ✅ Complete successful transactions | +3 points |
| ✅ Get disputes resolved in your favor | +5 points |

### How Trust Can Drop

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| ❌ Return items 1-3 days late | -5 points |
| ❌ Return items 3+ days late | -10 points |
| ❌ Have disputes raised against you | -15 points |

### Why Trust Score Matters

- Higher trust = More people want to trade with you
- Higher trust = Your items appear higher in search
- Higher trust = Faster request approvals

**Start at 50. Build it up through good behavior!**
